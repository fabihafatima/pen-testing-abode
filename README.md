## Architecture & Technologies

* **Language**: 100% Python (used Django)
* **Modular design**: Each tool exists as a stand-alone script for ease of maintenance and use&#x20;
* **Extensions-ready**: Ideal scaffold for plugins, automation scripts, or integration with CI/CD pipelines

## Setup & Installation

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed on Linux:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fabihafatima/Pen-testing-Abode.git
cd Pen-testing-Abode
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Usage**

Each tool lives in its own file. Run them directly:

```bash
python webcrawler.py --help
python arp_spoof.py --target 192.168.1.5
```

Adjust flags based on tool (e.g., `--interface`, `--output`). Individual scripts include inline help.

## Usage Examples

### üåê Web Crawler

```bash
python webcrawler.py --url https://example.com --depth 2
```

Maps out website structure for manual review or automated scanning.

### üõ°Ô∏è Vulnerability Scanner

```bash
python vuln_scanner.py --host 10.0.0.12 --port 80
```

Scans for known services and misconfigurations for pen‚Äëtest prep.

### üß† ARP Spoofer

```bash
sudo python arp_spoof.py --victim 10.0.0.5 --gateway 10.0.0.1 --interface eth0
```

Intercepts network traffic between victim and router.
